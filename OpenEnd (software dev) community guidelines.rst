====================================
Welcome to OpenEnd contribution guidelines page. OpenEnd is the open source collaborative software development end of I.0.Stream. Members of I.0.Community 

Since you have made it this far, we hope you enjoyed your stay in OpenEnd. We are happy to have you here as well. This guide will help you understand different roles in the organization, what are their duties, what are the benefits of taking those roles, what are the consequences of failing in those roles.

There are 3 roles that may be given to any individual :-

|1. Project Developers
|2. Project Managers.
|3. Moderators.

**Project Developers**

They are the ones who work under a project manager on a particular project. They do work like writing code, writing documentation, setting up test like TDD and Travis CI,etc.

_Benefits of getting this role_

The number one benefit of getting this role is _experience_. You won’t get another opportunity to work on a live project with other students like you guided by an _experienced_ mentor. This will increase your knowledge and skill. The second benefit is since all your contribution will be on github, there will be proof of your contribution that you can show others.

_Consequences of falling this role_

Well, When we talk about failing what does it mean to fail? If you inactive and does not respond to project manager, then yes that is failing. In that case, you will be removed from the project. If you are inexperienced with code and failed to code then that’s not failing. Remember you can also help with the documentation and testing. So don’t give up, never give up.

**Project Managers**

They are the one managing the project. As a Project Manager your first responsibility is to manage people. As a manager, you have to update documentation and distribute responsibilities. Discuss with the people how will you do the project and what is the action plan. Give them a clear cut direction on how to do the project. Make sure several people are not working on the same issues. Remove the inaction devs. It any conflict arise, resolve it. As a manager, you are answerable to admins. It is your responsibility to maintain master. Also, If there aren’t enough devs, you may also have to work as developer too.

_Benefits of getting this role_

You get hand on _experience_ working as a manager. You also get the credit for the project hosted under an open source initiative IOStream-OpenEnd.

_Consequences of falling in this role_

If you fail in this role. Your badge as a manager will be taken away.

After reading about the each roles, you may have gotten an idea about these roles. You can reach out to @Admins or @Supragya Raj for these roles.
