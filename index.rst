==================
How are you today?
==================
Welcome to I.0.Space information page. We are thrilled that you have subscribed to I.0.Stream / I.0.Space. You will be glad to know that there is much more awaiting discovery than meets the eye.

Let me take you through a few things you can expect from I.0.Space:

1. **OpenEnd**: We have our own open source organization. Albeit new, this place hosts many community driven projects for and by people who are interested in various domains - Machine Learning / Deep Learning / WebApps / Desktop applications / Cloud based services etc. (basically anything you can imagine). We are open to contributions from anyone and most of the projects undertaken do not have very high prerequisites. Know more.

2. **Community**: I.0.Space has a community end on discord, where people come and meet, have chat with creator of I.0.Space - Supragya Raj (that's me lol). Also, the project meetings (OpenEnd) happen just here. There are subventures like competitive programming channels etc here. Know more.

3. **I.0.Stream (YouTube)**: Perhaps the most common of all the ventures undertaken, I.0.Stream is a place where you find videos relating to technology, software development, computer science, perspectives and outlooks and much more. Know more.

======================================
Hey, I want to quickly know everything
======================================

To keep the story short (although there is much more to know), here is the set of things you can do:

1. **Ask us questions**: Get on to I.0.Community discord channel and ask appropriate people your questions that you want answered. The invite link should be given below. Make sure you do not DM. Use `@mention` (e.g. `@ayushnihal`) to mention appropriate person.

2. **Take up moderation duties**: I.0.Community needs people who can moderate the room and also maintain these documentations. People who are interested in management and leadership are best suited for this role. Get on to discord and ask already existing moderators and/or admins if they need your services (which they almost always will).

3. **Take up available projects**: OpenEnd has a few projects under its organizations and a few developers are already working on them to make them a success. If you want to hone your programming / leadership / documentation skills, you can ask Project Managers for letting you in a project that you like. The list of available projects would be in the `#announcements` text channel.

4. **Lead a new project**: Maybe something you like to work on doesn't already exist. Well, you can always ask OpenEnd Managers if you start a new project under OpenEnd. You need to pitch in your idea, tell them your proposal... and if we find it interesting to lead new developers into, we can take that up under OpenEnd.

5. **Be a dormant player**: Well, your wish really :).
